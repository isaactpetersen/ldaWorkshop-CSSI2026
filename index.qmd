This is the website for the 2026 Center for Social Science Innovation (CSSI) Workshop on Longitudinal Data Analysis led by [Isaac T. Petersen](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/people/isaac-petersen).
Isaac is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa.

This workshop provides an applied overview of principles and methods for longitudinal data analysis, with hands-on examples in [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org).
Topics include types of longitudinal data, data manipulation and visualization, statistical methods for longitudinal analysis (including mixed-effects models and structural equation models), longitudinal measurement invariance, handling missing data, and separating within-person and between-person effects.
Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop with [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org) and [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed for interactive exercises.
